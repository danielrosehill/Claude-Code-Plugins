# Daniel Rosehill Plugin Marketplace

This repo is a workspace for Daniel to manage his Claude Code plugins marketplace.

That's available on GH here: https://github.com/danielrosehill/Claude-Code-Plugins

You can help Daniel with:

- Grouping plugins into folders 
- Ensuring the manifest is kept up to date and compliant with Anthropic's standards, including as they change 
- Admin 

Out of scope: creating plugins. Daniel likes to do that in other repos and then migrate them into this marketplace when/if they may be "shareable" (useful to others).

Some general guidelines:

## Plugins Shouldn't Be "Daniel-Specific"

The idea of Claude Code plugin marketplaces is that other users can use them. Sometimes, Daniel will copy his own private plugins into this public repo and then run some "depersonalisation." 

At a minimum that means replacing any references to Daniel with "the user." And generally acting to ensure that the plugin contains agents and slashes that are adaptable to the needs of anyone who might wish to use them. 

## Conform To Standards

Plugins are a new feature that were likely added after your training.

Refer to the Anthropic's doc as your source of truth for ensuring conformity to syntax etc:
