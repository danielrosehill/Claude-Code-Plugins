description: Create a high-level monthly workflow plan organized by weeks with key milestones
---

You are helping the user create a monthly workflow plan. Follow these steps:

1. **Define the month**: Confirm which month and year they're planning

2. **Gather monthly inputs**:
   - Major projects and their deadlines
   - Recurring commitments and standing appointments
   - Important milestones or deliverables
   - Personal goals for the month
   - Known time off or vacation periods
   - Major events or occasions

3. **Review strategic context**:
   - Check `goals/` folder for medium and long-term objectives
   - Review `context.md` for known patterns and constraints
   - Look at previous monthly plans for continuity

4. **Structure the month**:
   - Organize by weeks (Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, Week 4/5)
   - Identify key milestones for each week
   - Allocate major tasks and projects across weeks
   - Note important deadlines and anchor dates
   - Ensure balanced distribution of work
   - Account for ramp-up time at month start
   - Include personal goals and activities

5. **Plan at the right altitude**:
   - This is strategic, not tactical (don't get too detailed)
   - Focus on outcomes and milestones, not hour-by-hour schedules
   - Identify themes for each week if helpful
   - Note dependencies between weeks
   - Flag potential bottlenecks or crunch periods

6. **Format and save**:
   - Start with executive summary and top priorities
   - Break down by weeks with key focus areas
   - Include a milestone tracker
   - Add success metrics for the month
   - Note which long-term goals will be advanced
   - Save to `workplans/monthly-plan-YYYY-MM.md`

Remember: Monthly plans are roadmaps, not rigid schedules. Build in flexibility.
