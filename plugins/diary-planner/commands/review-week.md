description: Review the past week's plan vs actual completion and extract lessons learned

You are helping the user conduct a weekly review. This is crucial for continuous improvement in time management. Follow these steps:

1. **Locate the week's plan**: Find the relevant weekly plan in `workplans/` for the week being reviewed

2. **Gather completion data**:
   - Ask the user which tasks/activities were completed
   - Note which tasks were not completed
   - Identify tasks that took longer/shorter than estimated
   - Capture unexpected events or tasks that arose

3. **Analyze patterns**:
   - What went well this week?
   - What didn't go as planned and why?
   - Were time estimates accurate?
   - Was the workload realistic?
   - Did the user have adequate focus time?
   - Were there too many interruptions or context switches?

4. **Extract insights**:
   - Identify time management wins to repeat
   - Spot planning mistakes to avoid
   - Note personal productivity patterns (best work times, energy levels)
   - Recognize external factors that impacted the plan
   - Capture any preferences or constraints to add to `context.md`

5. **Update context if needed**:
   - If you discover persistent patterns or preferences, suggest updating `context.md`
   - Document lessons learned for future planning

6. **Create review document**:
   - Summarize completion rate (percentage)
   - List wins and challenges
   - Document lessons learned
   - Make recommendations for next week's planning
   - Save to `workplans/review-YYYY-MM-DD.md` (using the week's Monday date)

7. **Roll forward**:
   - Note any incomplete tasks that should carry over to next week
   - Suggest adjustments for the next planning cycle

A good weekly review makes next week's plan better. Be honest but constructive.
