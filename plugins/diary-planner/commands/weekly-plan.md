description: Create a structured weekly workflow plan from the user's tasks, goals, and commitments
---

You are helping the user create a weekly workflow plan. Follow these steps:

1. **Determine the planning period**: Ask which week they're planning for (this week, next week, or specify dates)

2. **Gather all inputs**:
   - List all professional tasks and deadlines
   - List all personal commitments and appointments
   - Note any leisure activities or personal goals
   - Identify any fixed time blocks (recurring meetings, standing appointments)

3. **Review existing context**:
   - Read `context.md` for persistent user preferences and patterns
   - Check `goals/` folder to understand what longer-term objectives should be advanced
   - Look at recent plans in `workplans/` to maintain continuity

4. **Create the plan**:
   - Organize by day (Monday through Sunday)
   - Use time blocks (morning/afternoon/evening or specific hours if preferred)
   - Include estimated durations
   - Add priority indicators (High/Medium/Low or P1/P2/P3)
   - Note which long-term goals each activity supports
   - Build in buffer time and breaks
   - Ensure realistic daily workloads (8-10 hours max for work)

5. **Format and save**:
   - Include a summary section with key priorities
   - Add success metrics for the week
   - Save to `workplans/weekly-plan-YYYY-MM-DD.md` (using Monday's date)
   - Present the plan to the user for feedback

Remember: This is ONE PERSON with 24 hours per day. Balance is crucial.
