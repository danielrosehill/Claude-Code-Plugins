description: Create a detailed daily workflow plan with specific time blocks and priorities
---

You are helping the user create a daily workflow plan. Follow these steps:

1. **Identify the target date**: Confirm which day they're planning (today, tomorrow, or specific date)

2. **Gather daily inputs**:
   - Fixed appointments and meetings (with specific times)
   - Tasks from ongoing projects
   - Urgent items requiring attention
   - Personal commitments
   - Desired personal activities or goals

3. **Review context**:
   - Check `context.md` for the user's typical daily patterns and preferences
   - Review weekly plan if one exists for this week
   - Check `goals/` to see what should be advanced today
   - Note any task dependencies or prerequisites

4. **Structure the day**:
   - Start with fixed commitments (meetings, appointments)
   - Allocate deep work blocks for high-priority tasks (90-120 min recommended)
   - Schedule admin/email time
   - Include breaks (at least 5-10 min per hour)
   - Plan transitions between tasks
   - Consider energy levels (complex work during peak hours)
   - Leave buffer time for unexpected issues (20% of day)

5. **Format and save**:
   - Use hourly or time-block format (whatever works best for user)
   - Include task durations and priorities
   - Note which goals each task advances
   - Add a "Today's Top 3" section for key priorities
   - Save to `workplans/daily-plan-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
   - Present for user feedback and adjustment

Key principle: A realistic daily plan has breathing room. Don't overschedule.
