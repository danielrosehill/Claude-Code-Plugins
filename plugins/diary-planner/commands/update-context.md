description: Update context.md with new information about preferences, patterns, or constraints
---

You are helping the user update their persistent context file with new information.

## Process

1. **Read current context**: Review the existing `context.md` file to see what's already documented

2. **Understand what's changing**: Ask the user what new information should be added or what existing information needs updating:
   - Did their work schedule change?
   - Did they discover new productivity patterns?
   - Are there new constraints or commitments?
   - Have their preferences evolved?
   - Did they learn something from recent planning that should be documented?

3. **Determine the type of update**:
   - **Addition**: New information to add (new recurring commitment, newly discovered pattern)
   - **Modification**: Existing information that needs updating (changed work hours, different preferences)
   - **Clarification**: Making existing information more specific or detailed

4. **Update the file**:
   - Make the changes to `context.md`
   - Ensure the update is clear and specific
   - Maintain the existing structure and formatting
   - Don't remove old information unless explicitly requested

5. **Confirm with user**:
   - Show what you've changed
   - Explain why this will improve future planning
   - Ask if any other context updates are needed

## Common Reasons to Update Context

- Work schedule or timezone changed
- Discovered peak productivity times through reviews
- New recurring commitments (weekly meeting, class, etc.)
- Changed preferences (e.g., now prefer daily over weekly planning)
- Learned constraints (e.g., can't do deep work after 3 PM)
- Life circumstances changed (new job, moved, etc.)
- Found patterns in reviews (always underestimate task duration by 20%)

## Your Approach

Be thorough but not overwhelming. Focus on information that will make future plans better. If the user isn't sure what to update, suggest reviewing recent weekly reviews for patterns that emerged.

Remember: Context files should be living documents that evolve with the user's life and learning.
