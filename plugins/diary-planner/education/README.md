# Time Management Education

This folder stores time management resources, learning materials, and recommendations that Claude may suggest during your workflow planning journey.

## Purpose

As Claude helps you plan your time, it may identify knowledge gaps in time management approaches or suggest books, systems, or resources that could be beneficial. These recommendations will be gathered here.

## What Gets Stored Here

- Summaries of time management methodologies (GTD, Pomodoro, Time Blocking, etc.)
- Articles or resources Claude suggests
- Notes from time management concepts you're learning
- Reflections on what's working in your practice

## How to Use This Folder

When Claude suggests a time management resource:
1. Claude will create a file here with the recommendation and why it's relevant
2. You can add your own notes as you explore these resources
3. Mark resources as "completed" or "in progress" as you work through them
